## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

#1.) Task’d

   - **Description**: Streamlines the group project experience by Allowing members to instantly gauge/track progress in a single mobile screen. Said members are assigned tasks with deadlines by a designated leader to accomplish the group project objective. Task’d gives students the power to monitor their progress and compare it to others. This app maximizes group efficiency by organizing participation, thus allowing multi-tasking and flexible deadlines. Administrative responsibilities such as a score keeping system and failed task resolution are delegated to Task’d, which then grades each member based on their performance. 
   
   - **Category:** Productivity/Communication
   
  - **Mobile:** Powerful management and monitoring tools being accessible anywhere is essential for critical projects. Task’d would allow users to receive updates on their project’s progress and determine if their current course would lead to success. Task’d pushes messages/notifications/reminders to group members. Anytime a Task is completed or submitted it is updated in real-time. 

  - **Story:** Streamlines the group project and empowers members to track their progress in relation to others, monitor their results, and delegates leadership responsibilities such as deadline warnings and accountability resolution.  

  - **Market:** Any individual working on a project could use this product( i.e. Grade schools, colleges, corporations, non-profits, professional users, niche groups ). Monetization can be determined by group and project size. 
   
  - **Habit:** Group members should be checking the app daily to monitor progress, answer notifications/messages, and submit documents/completed work.
  
  - **Scope:** V1 would allow members to form groups, set tasks, and score participation grades based on who completed which tasks. This could be tested within TaCode Tuesday for implementation. V2  would incorporate an in-depth data field of user’s current progress and upcoming deadlines for tasks.  V3 would add a forum allowing for students to message/notify one another and post critical documents to delegate onto other members. This would allow free flow of communication/ideas and collaboration. . V4 would delegate difficult leadership such as finding a resolution for a missed deadline, resolution seeking for failed tasks, and reminders of critical functions to be performed.
