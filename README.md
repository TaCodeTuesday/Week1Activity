## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Spotify  
  - **Category:** Music & Audio 
  - **Mobile:** Both mobile and website allows you to play music  
  - **Story:** Allows users to stream music from a database of songs online  
  - **Market:** Everyone who likes to stream music  
  - **Habit:** Users access the app anytime they want to listen to music and they can explore 
a large library of music. This could lead someone to explore music for hours.
  - **Scope:** The service had a large scope focusing on features such as sharing tracks
and subscribing to other user's playlists, features which are still available. The service was 
only offered to users who were invited or that paid for the subscription. This led to limited 
free trials and then to the current unlimited free trial with paid premium features.
### iFunny
  - **Category:** Entertainment
  - **Mobile:** Website is view only, with a store. Mobile first experience, allows you to post
pictures by allowing the app access to your photo library.
  - **Story:** Allows users to post and share funny pictures, memes, and GIF's. Allows users to
also comment on the posts.
  - **Market:** Because of the lack of filters, parental controls, or age verification this app is best
suited for adults and maybe teenagers. The app does have hastags which allows users to find relevant content.
  - **Habit:** Users can post as many times as they want and can scroll through a large ammount of pictures
while engaging with other users.
  - **Scope:** The app launched with a narrow focus with only three features: 'Recent, Popular, Create.'
The focus is still somewhat narrow but appeals to a larger audience with more social features and allows
for the creation of comics, GIF's, memes, etc.
